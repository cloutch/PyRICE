# PyRICE
Python Implementation of RICE-2010 with Global Optimization

This code is an implementation of William Nordhaus' RICE model. It is based, on the one hand, on the Python implementation of DICE-2016 by Hazem Krichene (as far as code main structure is concerned) and, on the other hand, on RICE-2010 Excel sheet (as far as calibration, parameters and so on are concerned).

It proceeds in the following way : first, importation of packages and initialization of model parameters ; second, declaration of model functions, both for exogenous and endogenous variables ; third, definition of optimization function and of system computation function ; last, model lauching and graphs plotting.
